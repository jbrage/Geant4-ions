# Geant4: 200 MeV/u carbon ions in water


### Scoring
* the dose for primaries and secondaries for a given atomic number 
* the fluence-averaged LET or whatever quantity specified in the routine
* Saves histograms to 
```
mkdir -p build/histograms
```


### Validation 
* the dose distributions for the ion fragments are identical to figure 2 in  
_Gunzert-Marx, K., et al. "Secondary beam fragments produced by 200 MeV uâˆ’ 1 12C ions in water and their dose contributions in carbon ion radiotherapy." New journal of physics 10.7 (2008): 075003._
